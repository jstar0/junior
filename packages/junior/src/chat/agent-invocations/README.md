# Agent Invocations

This module owns durable parent-to-child agent work. It gives delegated work a
stable identity, schedules it through the shared conversation mailbox, and
stores the terminal result for its parent to read later.

## Records

- An **agent binding** maps one name within a parent agent conversation to one
  destinationless child conversation and its reasoning policy. Reusing the
  name reuses that child's history; an omitted reasoning level inherits the
  binding, while an explicit mismatch is rejected.
- An **agent invocation** is one retry-safe task sent to a child. Its
  `invocationId` is derived from the parent conversation and caller-supplied
  idempotency key.
- An invocation without a name gets an invocation-scoped child conversation.
- Child conversation lineage is immutable. Bindings and invocation content are
  purged with their root conversation tree. Recursive delegation is disabled
  until depth, cancellation, and authority rules are defined.

SQL owns bindings, invocation status, bounded execution authority, and terminal
results. The conversation event log and session record continue to own agent
history and resumable execution. Mailbox entries contain only the invocation
reference needed to join those records. Invocation content inherits the root
conversation's visibility and retention window and is deleted with that
conversation tree.

## Execution

1. Creation writes the invocation before attempting the mailbox append.
2. The idempotent mailbox append sends a normal conversation queue wake.
3. The invocation router recognizes destinationless child work and advances it
   through the shared `AgentRunner`.
4. A cooperative yield keeps the same turn and invocation active for another
   execution slice.
5. Completion writes the session record first, then projects the immutable
   result or error onto the invocation.
6. The heartbeat repairs invocations left in `mailboxStatus: "pending"`.

The child conversation has no provider destination. Each invocation carries
the actor, credential context, source, and destination that bound its tool
execution. Child output is an internal result; provider delivery remains owned
by the parent-facing runtime.

## Current Boundary

`spawnAgent` exposes durable creation to a parent agent. The tool receives only
the delegated task, optional child name, and optional reasoning level. The
runtime derives actor, credentials, destination, visibility, source, parent
conversation, and idempotency from the active tool call.

This slice does not yet expose result recovery, inject child results into a
parent turn, support recursive children, or implement cancellation. Those
behaviors should build on the invocation record rather than introducing another
scheduler or execution loop.
