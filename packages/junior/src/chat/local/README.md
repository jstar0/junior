# Local Agent

The local CLI exercises the shared conversation runtime without Slack or the
provider mailbox worker.

## Contract

- `junior chat -p <prompt>` executes one turn; interactive mode reuses one
  process-scoped conversation until exit.
- Conversation IDs use `local:<workspace-key>:<conversation-slug>`.
- Source context is local and the credential actor is the `local-cli` user.
  OAuth authorization links are printed in the terminal; the CLI waits for the
  callback and resumes the same turn.
- User input is persisted before execution; each completed tool-free assistant
  message is written to stdout and recorded in conversation order. Text emitted
  alongside tool calls remains internal. Post-delivery state is attempted
  immediately, then persisted again at turn completion.
- Each invocation uses a collision-resistant turn ID independent of transcript
  length. It records `turn_started` after durable input, then a terminal
  success, no-reply, or privacy-safe failure after the owning boundary.
- Intentional no-reply turns do not call the stdout sink and do not synthesize
  an assistant transcript message.
- Event appends are idempotent when explicitly retried, but stdout acceptance
  and SQL persistence are not one transaction. A process death in that interval
  can strand a started turn; lifecycle history does not claim otherwise.
- New CLI invocations do not promise restoration of prior interactive history.
- Child-agent work uses the shared invocation mailbox worker in the CLI
  process. Prompt mode drains accepted child work before exit; interactive mode
  drains it when the session exits. It does not depend on a Vercel Queue dev
  consumer, and a process death can still strand process-local mailbox state.
- Status and diagnostics go to stderr; assistant messages go to stdout in model
  message order.
- Local file requests use paths named by the user. The adapter does not
  synthesize Slack attachments or file-delivery tools.
- Local OAuth uses the configured public `JUNIOR_BASE_URL` callback, then a
  signed redirect to a loopback listener owned by the CLI process. Keep the
  local dev server and tunnel running so the provider callback can reach that
  relay. Plugin credentials are copied back to the dev server over a signed
  loopback request so sandbox egress can issue a lease after the turn resumes;
  the credential is never sent to the sandbox.

`conversation.ts` owns identity normalization and `runner.ts` owns the direct
runtime path. Manual validation is documented in
`packages/docs/src/content/docs/contribute/local-agent-validation.md`.
